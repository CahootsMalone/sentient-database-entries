Torindine Empire<br />
<br />
The Torindine Empire was the last of the great <a href="558.html">Vell Dynasties</a>. Forged from the ruins of the <a href="566.html">Bellimost Empire</a>, the Torindine Empire was marked by the near fanatical devotion of <a href="585.html">Emperor Torindal</a> to exploration and conquest. During the Torindine Reign, the Imperial <a href="611.html">Navy</a> rose as the greatest <a href="333.html">power</a> ever to control the void between the stars. It also saw the greatest loss of life imaginable when the Imperial <a href="611.html">Navy</a> discovered a <a href="606.html">navigation</a> lane leading to the <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a>.</body></html>
