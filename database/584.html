Border Skirmishes<br />
<br />
The Border Skirmishes were a series of naval engagements which let to the <a href="571.html">Insect War L1/L2</a> <a href="572.html">L3/L4</a>. Attempting to protect Imperial citizens from <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a> encroachment, <a href="586.html">Vice-Admiral Yernin</a> elected to blockade all <a href="606.html">navigation</a> lanes to Imperial Space. The Insects chose to run the blockade in an attempt to gain a foothold in the Torindine Systems.<br />
In truth, there was no blockade. Rather, Yernin set a trap in order to capture a <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a> barque and analyze its technology. Unfortunately, her trap failed and her fleet was destroyed. This defeat was used by the Ministry of Expression to spur the populace to accept the <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a> as a serious threat to the Imperium. It also marked the first usage of the term "insect" in reference to the <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a>.</body></html>
