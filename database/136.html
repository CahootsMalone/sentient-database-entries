Particle Deceleration Lab<br />
<br />
Testing of the speed-decay factor for <a href="624.html">Kenyons</a> is undertaken using the <a href="223.html">Deceleration Tube</a>. The Kenyon particles' vibrations can be lowered and made manageable by a magnetic stasis field. Later they can be stored safely in liquid Helium.</body></html>
