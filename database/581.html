Duach Dah MeYar<br />
<br />
A book written in <a href="607.html">Chudani</a> and known throughout the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a>, this religious tract foretells the coming of the Dah MeYar, a messiah who will lead the people to enlightenment. The book has been interpreted differently for hundreds of years by many scholars and religious leaders. The nature of the Dah MeYar, and the event he will eventually save humanity from have become the subject of hundreds of books, essays and debates. Over one hundred years ago, the Duach was fed into a massive computer for interpretation. Unfortunately, the program was so large, the computer was forced to divert all its processing <a href="333.html">power</a> to its use and the study was shut down.</body></html>
