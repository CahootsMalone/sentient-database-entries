<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Chavarik's stated goal is a life of relative ease. His assignment aboard the Icarus, although physically demanding, is looked upon as a simple assignment needing little thought. This <a href="552.html">political officer</a> has requested his reassignment--transmitted aboard the last pinnace. The Icarus is too vital a station to have this man in as sensitive a position as a <a href="349.html">security</a> sergeant. Status WATCH<br />
