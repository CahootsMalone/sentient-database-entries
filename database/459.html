Vonn Medler has several issues originating in his childhood. He is overly attracted to strong females, specifically those with no interest in him.

<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Due to their constant contact with the <a href="352.html">engineering section</a>, I am lowering the status of both medtechs Medler and Kata FILE NUMBER PCF02511 to OBSERVE. MT Medler has shown obvious romantic interest in ERM Mandana FILE NUMBER PCF18745. Should this interest become reciprocated, a Course of Action Report will be filed immediately. <br />
