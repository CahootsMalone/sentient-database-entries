Bloor<br />
<br />
Originally the home of the Zercesians, Bloor's <a href="341.html">atmosphere</a> was rendered unlivable by weapons testing roughly one hundred years ago. Appealing to the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a> for assistance, the Zercesians entered into a pact with the Grand <a href="587.html">Senate</a>, becoming <a href="588.html">Bloodbound warriors</a> in service to the government in return for aid to their families. The <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a> acted quickly, mobilizing the largest humanitarian effort in the history of the <a href="559.html">Vell</a> Empires. The Bloodbound were relocated to <a href="667.html">Getach</a>.</body></html>
