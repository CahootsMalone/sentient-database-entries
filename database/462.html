PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE<br />
Tay Kata is a frustrated young woman, who cannot accept her place in the <a href="577.html">Collective</a> order. She harbors conflicting feelings of superiority/inferiority, specifically towards crew members within the <a href="352.html">engineering section</a>, whom she must deal with on a day-to-day basis.<br />

<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Kata's attack at the Faralon Labs was precipitated by alleged cruelty to a worker specimen. The specimen broke loose and caused her wounds. It was quickly put down, and Kata transferred. Due to a clerical error, Kata was transferred to the Icarus, where several specimens have been attached. Due to their constant contact with the <a href="352.html">engineering section</a>, I am lowering the status of both Medtechs Kata and Medler to OBSERVE. <br />
