Digitals<br />
<br />
Used originally to terraform new colonies, the Digitals' proved useful in clearing indigenous populations from important resource locations. Fail-safes within the Digitals' program matrices completely wipe their memories after ten years of field service.<br />
Recently however, a splinter group of scientific radicals has attempted to circumvent the Digital's programming so that they may continue to exist with their memories intact after the ten year ban is enacted. Who these radicals are remains a mystery, but the <a href="610.html">Magistrates</a> have been devoting time to little else but hunting Digitals for several years.</body></html>
