Barraga<br />
<br />
Barraga, a small yellow star, has the distinction of being the only sun in history to allow navigational lanes to two other systems: <a href="704.html">Veetoh</a> and <a href="635.html">Nephlon</a>. As such, this system contains the highest density of population, and enjoys its status as the commercial center to the galaxy. Unfortunately it is also the center of the <a href="608.html">Confederation of Democratic Provinces L1/L2</a> <a href="609.html">L3/L4</a>, and dedicated to free trade without Hegemony tariff restrictions. It contains three planets: <a href="691.html">Attag</a>, <a href="698.html">Churl</a>, and <a href="699.html">Yetchee</a>.</body></html>
