Canon of Conduct<br />
<br />
The law by which all are judged. Originally based upon the <a href="581.html">Duach Dah MeYar</a>, the Canon has undergone several rewrites during the reign of the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a>. These revisions, called the <a href="580.html">Articles of Domain L3/L4</a>, allow for the creation of the <a href="610.html">Magistrates</a> and the annexing of all astronomical bodies of the <a href="561.html">Frontier</a>.</body></html>
