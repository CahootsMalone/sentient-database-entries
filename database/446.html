BRIEF BACKGROUND<br />
Dr. Lunjoy is a full citizen who has enjoyed the fruits of his family's labour. His father was Dr. Pernoll Lunjoy, physician to Grand Senator Rimmin-Jassin and his mother was physician to his consort Grand Madam Herinna Bogg. With his father's resources, Pressim Lunjoy found acceptance to Nolmark without the usual bureaucracy. After finishing his doctorate, a place was instantly made for him as Personal Physician to Grand Senator Kimple-Trann. After only a few months of service, Lunjoy requested transfer to the <a href="314.html">Icarus Station</a>, stating that he was interested in treating the lower classes of society.
