BRIEF BACKGROUND<br />
Dr. Genshin Po graduated from Depottin with high marks, hoping to work in the private sector in his home city of <a href="657.html">Zaronee</a> so that he would not have to leave his new wife. The <a href="614.html">Citizen Selection Board</a> took pity on the man and after recruitment, assigned him to Randadam <a href="23.html">Observatory</a>, located within the same star system. Due to a clerical mistake, upon one of his bi-monthly visits home, his wife's license to conceive was granted and she became pregnant. This proved to be poor timing, as Dr. Po was needed at Flimbach. With the promotion he received, he was able to move his family to a level seven block, and was thus pacified. His transfer to the <a href="314.html">Icarus Station</a> was met with a great deal of resistance, however, reason prevailed.<br />
