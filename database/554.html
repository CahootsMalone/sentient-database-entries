A.H.C.<br />
<br />
A group of terrorist dedicated to the destruction of the Hegemony and the "freeing" of the Imperial Protectorates. Responsible for thirty-eight acts of terror across the <a href="561.html">Frontier</a>. No government agent has ever infiltrated the organization, and no one has uncovered what the initials A.H.C. stand for. Thus far, the A.H.C. has proven impenetrable by  government operatives and there is no end in sight to their activities.</body></html>
