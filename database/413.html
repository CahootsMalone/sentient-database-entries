BRIEF BACKGROUND<br />
Jigrette did well at Tranor, finishing in the upper percentile of her class. This made her eligible for enrollment in the <a href="635.html">Nephlon</a> Officer's Candidate Academy, however her family lacked the financial resources to advance her education and hierarchical standing. She brought attention to herself during her tour at the CPA when she averted an assassination attempt upon Over-Colonel Grishimm Walthin.
