Battle Over Krisbrun<br />
<br />
<a href="714.html">Senator Corrin Doralus-Tain L1/L2</a> <a href="715.html">L3/L4</a> and his three eldest sons were killed when their assault-corvette was shot down over the one of <a href="707.html">Marlith</a>'s vast deserts during the first invasion. The Senator, realizing death was imminent, managed to steer the corvette into the <a href="591.html">Livan'chu L1/L2</a> <a href="592.html">L3/L4</a> stronghold, and thus win the battle. The senator's youngest son was placed aboard a supply ship loaded with the <a href="591.html">Livan'chu L1/L2</a> <a href="592.html">L3/L4</a> treasury. Unfortunately, the ship never arrived at the <a href="635.html">Nephlon</a> System, thus ending the Doralus-Tain line.</body></html>
