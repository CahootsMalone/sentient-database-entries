<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Status is OBSERVE, however I recently noted that EO Evinroh visited the stateroom of Senator <a href="535.html">Tamorin Aidin-Edgell L1/L2</a> <a href="536.html">L3/L4</a> FILE NUMBER GSP0035 while the senator was otherwise occupied. As I was about to anonymously alert <a href="349.html">security</a>, I saw that the room was also occupied by the senator's assistant <a href="540.html">Vetta L1</a> <a href="541.html">L2</a> <a href="542.html">L3/L4</a> FILE NUMBER SCF21457.
