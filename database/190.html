Energy Grid<br />
<br />
Location: <a href="161.html">Secondary Engine Room</a><br />
The Energy Grid creates all <a href="333.html">power</a> used by the Icarus Sun Station. After matter is collected and transformed into energy, the energy is collected and distributed through the Energy Distribution Network.<br />
If the Grid's supply <a href="333.html">power</a> falls lower than the demands of the <a href="333.html">power</a> nodes, the nodes begin to fail. Only authorised personnel may change the priority system for the <a href="333.html">power</a> nodes.</body></html>
