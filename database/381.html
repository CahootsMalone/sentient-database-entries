Mason Garrilac<br />

<br />
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE<br />
Garrilac's Devil-May-Care/Joker attitude is a facade aimed at diffusing potentially hostile situations. He has developed this mask over the course of his long career in several hot spots in the Protectorates. Underneath this disrespectful exterior is a complex mind, serious and loyal to his men.<br />

<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
With almost no advanced education, it is a wonder that Garrilac has progressed as far as he has. However, it is quite clear that the man has both brains and experience, as well as a natural affinity for the workings of complex machinery. He is fiercely protective of his charges, however, and during his stay on Debirick, Garrilac went so far as to threaten a superior officer with physical violence for cutting back rations to Garrilac's men. This, coupled with Garrilac's affiliation with the shadowy Confederated Corps of Engineers makes him a liability. Status TERMINATE<br />
