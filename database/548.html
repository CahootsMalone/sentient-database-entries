<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
The members of this religious group maintain a strangle-hold on transportation which makes them dangerous even when as docile as this one seems. Because the <a href="593.html">Navigators</a> occasionally break with government policy to follow the word of their so-called "savior", general order 12 states that they should be placed on HEAVY WATCH on all assignments.</body></html>
