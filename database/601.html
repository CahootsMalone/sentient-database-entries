Telepathic Bond<br />
<br />
Called by the <a href="593.html">Navigators</a>, the <a href="599.html">Doh-Vet-Nahr</a>. According to researchers, the <a href="593.html">Navigators</a>' psychic connection while using their <a href="333.html">power</a> is transmitted via tachyon pulses emitted in the alpha band of the subatomic continuum. This band is thought to be readable with a Tachyon Tracker.<br />
Members of the <a href="615.html">Yysblan ThinkTank</a> have been working to reproduce this phenomenon so as to synthesize the Sorority's <a href="606.html">navigation</a> powers. In this way, the Hegemony's dependence upon the strong-willed <a href="593.html">Navigators</a> might be ended.</body></html>
