Bor Gunny<br />
<br />
FILE NUMBER<br />
PCF42765<br />
<br />
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE<br />
Gunny has a deep-seeded resentment of authority and all its trappings. This, coupled with a misogynistic streak makes it nearly impossible for him to relate to women in positions of <a href="333.html">power</a>. His demeanor is best described with the word "curmudgeon". <br />

<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Gunny is competent at all areas of <a href="346.html">engineering</a> within his jurisdiction. His lack of motivation, and unwillingness to commit himself to his work guarantee this to be the highest position he attains. He gets the job done IF you can find him. . .awake. Status WATCH<br />
No disciplinary notes, although I suspect Garrilac has destroyed several he personally wrote.</body></html>
