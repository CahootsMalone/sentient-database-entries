A.H.C.<br />
<br />
A terrorist group who's goal is nothing less than the complete destruction of the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a>. The A.H.C. is responsible for the destruction of nineteen government installations and the deaths of hundreds of innocent civil servants. Operations to shut down A.H.C. activity are proceeding well and their reign of terror are projected to end before the year's end.</body></html>
