BRIEF BACKGROUND<br />
Mason Garrilac joined the Confederated Corps of Engineers just after quitting trade school. He served on several low-level crews before the Confederation was co-opted by the Hegemony. It was then that an internal aptitude test confirmed his abilities. He was immediately sent to the Foristan Project where he distinguished himself as an <a href="622.html">Asset to the Hegemony</a>, thus upgrading his rank and unofficial status. Twenty-three years and five demanding missions later, Garrilac has been singled out as an individual who can travel great distances and complete complicated assignments under adverse or dangerous conditions.<br />
