<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />

His thorough knowledge of the <a href="314.html">Icarus Station</a>'s systems is due, in part, to computer aided training at Namgen.

Womak has been overheard arguing with the <a href="755.html">Chief Science Officer</a> <a href="373.html">Holman Azirra L1</a> <a href="374.html">L2</a> <a href="375.html">L3/L4</a> FILE NUMBER PCF45234.
