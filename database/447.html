<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
The story about Dr. Lunjoy wishing a transfer to the Icarus in order to treat the lower classes is, of course, absurd. Grand Senator Kimple-Trann is a notorious hypochondriac and Lunjoy made the simple mistake of telling him so. An immediate transfer followed. Lunjoy has made his feelings known regarding the stimulant injection of the engineers, however his statements have yet to become seditious.  Status <a href="626.html">LIGHT</a> OBSERVE<br />

Disciplinary Report: Unauthorized Use of Equipment--1st Offense.<br />
Lunjoy was found using astronomical instrumentation. Communication with senatorial staff <a href="552.html">political officer</a> confirms that Lunjoy is an amateur astronomer. No action recommended.</body></html>
