Jatilla Temple<br />
<br />
Attempts to determine the age of this structure place its construction before the migration of refugees to the <a href="561.html">Frontier</a>. Although some claim that the building was discovered and adopted by the <a href="593.html">Navigators</a>, others believe that the Sorority knew there would one day be a need for it , and so began construction hundreds of years before the <a href="575.html">Exodus</a>. Whatever the case, the Jatilla Temple is the religious center of the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a> and the home to the Sisters of the Dah MeYar.</body></html>
