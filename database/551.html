Jacomo<br />
<br />
FILE NUMBER<br />
GCF74101<br />
<br />
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE<br />
Per agreement with the <a href="594.html">Sorority of Navigators</a>, no psychological testing of a Sister is permitted. However, as Jacomo is not technically a member of the Sorority, he was tested while she was off station on a pinnace run. The boy is highly intelligent, but possessing a childlike view of the universe below the norm for his age. He has been heavily indoctrinated into the religion of the Dah MeYar, and his "faith" seems unshakable. He has no memory before his discovery by the Sisters.<br />

<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
This boy was not selected by the Board and is only aboard the Icarus because of his relation to Navigator Ta. He appears to be no threat to <a href="349.html">security</a>, however, because of his bizarre religious practices, his status is OBSERVE.<br />
