Departure Lounge 1<br />
<br />
Rendered safe by double air-locks this comfortable and welcoming lounge area is the first sight which most new arrivals get of Station Icarus and of course the last when a worker's shift has terminated. Access to other decks is via the Teleport Cubicles.</body></html>
