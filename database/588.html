Bloodbound Warriors<br />
<br />
The Zercesians, who bound themselves in perpetual servitude to the Imperial <a href="587.html">Senate</a>, vowing to die in their service. This bond is an unshakable blood oath of fealty that restrains the Zercesian from uttering a word against his master or raising a hand against him. They are likewise bound by a code of honor called <a href="589.html">Chulkah</a>. The Bloodbound are truly the most awesome warriors the galaxy has ever seen.</body></html>
