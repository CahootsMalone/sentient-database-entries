Lorimer Alignment<br />
<br />
An alignment of three constellations in the <a href="707.html">Marlith</a> northern hemisphere which takes place once every fifteen years. The alignment is the holiest of the religious festivals celebrated by the Sisters of the Dah MeYar, the <a href="594.html">Sorority of Navigators</a>. Also called the Day of Hope, the Lorimer Alignment is supposedly the day upon which the Dah MeYar and his <a href="718.html">Brethren</a> will be born.</body></html>
