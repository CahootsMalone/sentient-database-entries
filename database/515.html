BRIEF BACKGROUND<br />
Herig Phlaxomil began his career in the <a href="346.html">Engineering</a> Advancement System. He was selected for <a href="346.html">engineering</a> officer's training when an incident on <a href="637.html">Faraan</a> caused him to be jailed for several years. When Phlaxomil was released, he was granted permission to resume his career. During his tour on <a href="707.html">Marlith</a>, Phlaxomil became fluent in <a href="607.html">Chudani</a>. Unfortunately, this fluency with a seditious language was used as evidence against him during his trial.<br />
