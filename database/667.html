Getach<br />
<br />
Getach is a rugged planet with sparse natural resources. As such, it must rely on imports for much of its consumables. Getach is the home of the Zercesian Bloodbound, who were relocated after the <a href="341.html">atmosphere</a> on <a href="665.html">Bloor</a> was swept away after an accident involving weapons testing. Getach's only export is Gludnum, a radioactive molten-metal useful in interstellar engine reactors. The <a href="668.html">Debirick Deep-Interior Pumping Platform</a> is operated around the clock to draw the material from Getach's core. The planet is comprised of nine small continents, although only two have been completely explored. Major cities include <a href="669.html">Arin</a>, <a href="671.html">Farn</a>, and <a href="672.html">Graf</a>.</body></html>
