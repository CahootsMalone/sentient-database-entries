BRIEF BACKGROUND<br />
EO Nurtle saw some action while serving as a life support control operator at the Joridan Tracking Station. He was hospitalized after an attack by a hostile aquatic life-form. The life-form, which has yet to become classified, bit off his ear while he was installing a sonic detection device beneath the station. Later testing of the sonic device brought a swarm of the creatures, resulting in a shutdown of operations lasting several weeks. <br />
