<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
She is extremely talented, with a humanistic approach towards medicine that may hamper her ability to administrate under stress. Her actions on Nystin relay a deep attachment to her patients, regardless of political association. There is evidence that she is uncomfortable working with her husband as well as with Chief Jurell, whom she served with at Nystin. Arguments with Jurell at Nystin might have carried over to the Icarus - however, the extremes of euphoria and depression seem to stem from this relationship.
