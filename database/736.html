Ellis<br />
<br />
Ellis is often referred to as the "big city at the end of the universe". Although <a href="727.html">Quor</a> has a much higher population, the urban center of Ellis is considered the reason for traveling to the <a href="724.html">Pohl</a> System. Ellis has a reputation across the <a href="634.html">Seven Systems</a> as the vice capitol of the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a>, featuring cyber-brothels, Smart-Game hunting,  and all manner of pharmaceuticals. Many a citizen has been heard to shout "Off to Ellis!" upon receiving his year-end bonus from his employer.</body></html>
