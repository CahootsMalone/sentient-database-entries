<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Dr. Malichek is thoroughly disliked by all members of the <a href="347.html">medical</a> staff. This feeling was intensified when he recently filed a formal report citing several incidents of negligence on the part of his supervisor, Dr. Luvey. The report suggests that Dr. Luvey has become distracted from her work as a result of mounting 'personal' problems.  No evidence exists to corroborate this account.  Status <a href="626.html">LIGHT</a> OBSERVE<br />
No disciplinary notes.</body></html>
