Sle'Stacheyar<br />
<br />
A race of hostile aliens never seen by a citizen of the Empire. The Sle'Stacheyar were discovered during an exploratory mission of the <a href="569.html">Imperial Expeditionary Force L1/L2</a> <a href="570.html">L3/L4</a>. Judging by pictograms discovered at several abandoned Sle'Stacheyar colonies, Imperial scientists determined that the aliens were a race of highly advanced creatures with similar scientific and social abilities. After first contact with the <a href="569.html">Imperial Expeditionary Force L1/L2</a> <a href="570.html">L3/L4</a>, Emperor Torindine determined that the aliens posed a potential threat to the safety of the nearest system--Gerbanon. He ordered the destruction of any non-Imperial vessel found near Gerbanon. This led to the <a href="583.html">Border Skirmishes L1/L2</a> <a href="584.html">L3/L4</a>, the <a href="571.html">Insect War L1/L2</a> <a href="572.html">L3/L4</a>, and ultimately the launching of the <a href="617.html">Death's Head Missile L1/L2</a> <a href="618.html">L3/L4</a> by the enemy.</body></html>
