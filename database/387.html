<br />
PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE<br />
While Drassan is a scientific prodigy, and the <a href="354.html">science section</a>'s second officer, it should be pointed out that he is emotionally still an 18 year-old, and as such, has a great deal of personal development ahead of him. As with his role-model, Dr. Azirra, he is prone to obsessive behavior, often losing days of sleep while working on a given project. Drassan is an extroverted, emotional young man, and criticism from the wrong person could be a serious blow to his ego.<br />

<a href="552.html">POLITICAL OFFICER</a>'S COMMENTS<br />
Drassan has proven invaluable in his work at the <a href="314.html">Icarus Station</a>. His technical skills are excellent, but are overshadowed by his theoretical imagination. Perhaps the field is the best place for the boy, as he might prove stifled in academia. He is quite fond of both Dr. Azirra FILE NUMBER PCF45234 and <a href="397.html">Beemin Womak L1</a> <a href="398.html">L2</a> <a href="399.html">L3/L4</a> FILE NUMBER PCF01375, and should the two men disagree in the future, it will be quite hard for the boy to take sides.
