Confederation of Democratic Provinces<br />
<br />
An illegal government of radicals. The Confederation sees itself as representative of the people's will, however government officials are not allowed to choose their own leaders. Instead it is left to the uninformed masses to choose which populist demagogue will create and enforce the laws.<br />
Unfortunately for the <a href="576.html">New Hegemony</a>, the Confederation is proving prosperous in its trade practices. As a result, its citizens are enjoying economic privileges heretofore unknown to the populace. It may prove hard to break.</body></html>
