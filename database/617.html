Death's Head Missile<br />
<br />
A weapon of near unimaginable magnitude, the Death's Head Missile is capable of destroying a star and wiping out all life in a system. At the end of the <a href="571.html">Insect War L1/L2</a> <a href="572.html">L3/L4</a>, the <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a> mounted their final assault upon the <a href="557.html">Torindine Empire</a>. One by one, they launched the Death's Head Missiles toward the thirteen suns that comprised Imperial Space. One by one the thirteen suns winked out of existence, and with them, all life on their inhabited planets. By destroying the stars, the <a href="567.html">Sle'Stacheyar L1/L2</a> <a href="568.html">L3/L4</a> made <a href="606.html">navigation</a> of the Grand Imperial Fleet impossible, obstructing any rescue operations. As the last of the Death's Head Missiles was launched towards the remaining star, the Grand Imperial Fleet gathered what refugees it could, and navigated through the only remaining path to the <a href="561.html">Frontier</a>.</body></html>
